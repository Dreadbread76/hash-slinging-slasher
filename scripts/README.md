# The script library

Two kinds of thing live here, and the difference matters.

**Reconnaissance** answers "what should I run tonight?" Run these before choosing a method; they
cost seconds and they are the difference between a night that adds something and a night that
repeats somebody.

**Generators** are methods. They print candidate names to standard output and you pipe them into
`confirm_list`, which does the careful half — the game's hash, the unnamed set, exclusion against
the tables, the run notes, results that only ever grow.

```
python scripts/continuations.py | bin\windows\confirm_list.exe - --label "per-prefix continuations"
```

That is the whole shape of inventing a method here. **You do not have to write Rust.** A method is
a program that prints names; anything that can print names is a method.

## Reconnaissance

| script | answers |
|---|---|
| `coverage.py` | where the unnamed assets actually are, per pool, per game. **Run this before believing a pool is worth a night.** |
| `methods_report.py` | what every submission was, what it cost and what it returned, **credited to the run that found it**. `--by-method` ranks by candidates per name; `--families` folds tuning variants so a method is one row; `--efficiency` shows the decay from a method's best run to its latest; `--unattributed` shows what cannot be credited; `--registry --write` regenerates the computed half of METHODS.md. |
| `families.py` | the shape of what has been found — directories, leading and trailing tokens, segment counts, numbered families and which members are missing. |
| `cross_type.py --measure` | how strongly one asset type's names predict another's. Measured, not assumed. |
| `seams.py` | **every** relation between asset types, not one: each type reduced every way, on each side independently, so a seam needing a different reduction per side is visible. It found the material→image seam at 5× the figure `cross_type` records. Read its note on why `only in A` is not a yield estimate. |
| `seam_stems.py` | turns a seam `seams.py` measured into the three lists a plan needs, and with `--write-plan` writes the plan itself. The path from "this relation looks real" to "these names are confirmed", without a new generator. |
| `collect_names.py` | rebuilds `all_names/` -- every name in every merged submission, as one sorted file per game and asset type. Run by CI on each submission; you want the folder, not this. |
| `snapshot.py` | run directly for a one-line summary per game. Used as a library by everything else. |
| `dedupe_contributed.py` | removes byte-identical copies from `scripts/contributed/`, keeping the earliest. Run by CI on each submission, because `submit`'s ledger only stops duplicates from clients that have pulled it. |
| `running.py` | **is anything grinding right now?** Lists searches *and the runners that restart them*, and `--stop` kills runners first. Run it before timing anything or assuming the machine is idle -- a loop believed killed on 2026-08-22 ran for seven and a half more hours because only its child was checked. |
| `check_docs.py` | whether the documentation still describes the repository that exists. Runs in CI. |
| `uncarried.py` | the beginnings `data/prefixes.txt` carries **no cut of**, so the general search cannot build a single name starting that way. 208 of them head 12,311 published names, including the whole optics family (`reflex_`, `acog_`, `holo_`). `--write-plan` turns them into a plan. |
| `overlap.py` | how much ground a plan shares with searches other people have already run. The fingerprint answers "identical or not" and is blind to a plan sharing nine tenths of its stems with last night's; this estimates that from the sketches runs now record. Advice, never a gate. |
| `reach.py` | **what share of known names the lists could rebuild at all.** A ceiling, not a yield: whatever the lists cannot express, no pass can find however long it runs, and nothing in a run says so. `--missing` names the commonest beginnings and endings not carried. |

## Generators

| script | builds candidates by |
|---|---|
| `final_byte.py` | **solves** rather than searches: the hash inverts for a name's final character, so an unnamed id gives its own last byte back. One name per 18 candidates, the best measured here. `--targets` shows what it answered. |
| `tails.py` | writes a plan asking "is this a known name with its last *k* characters replaced". The generalisation of `final_byte.py` past the one character that can be solved -- by peeling, since the hash keeps no resemblance past two. k=3 is **free** and returned 1,151. |
| `tails.py --head` | the same with the lists swapped: replaces a known name's **first** k characters. Untried until 2026-08-22 and returned **692 on Cold War in one pass** -- check the mirror of anything that works. |
| `sab_plan.py` | `sabpaths`' vocabulary asked as a whole product rather than sampled -- 187 B candidates, unfolded, at the largest unnamed pool in either game. **Measured dead, with a 387/391 positive control.** |
| `cross_era.py` | the newer titles' (`_v2`) names reduced to cores and respelled our way. Those tables are recorded dead *hashed verbatim*; this asks the different question, and brings in 2,394,179 cores our corpus does not have. |
| `splice.py` | head of one real name joined to the tail of another. **Measured dead** -- 1 per 13.7 billion -- and kept as the measurement. Read its note before building anything that recombines across names. |
| `derive_closure.py` | not a generator itself — it runs every **derivation** over what has just been confirmed and repeats until nothing new comes. Derivations refill as the corpus grows, so this is worth running after any pass at all. It terminates; it cannot grind bare ground. |
| `precedents.py` | the mirror of `continuations.py`: offers each **suffix** the tokens measured to have *preceded* it. Nothing had ever asked the question backwards. A generator rather than a plan on purpose -- each suffix gets only its own precedents, and crossing them all is what `splice.py` measured dead. |
| `continuations.py` | offering each prefix the tokens measured to follow **that** prefix, rather than the tokens that are globally common. Directory prefixes get the whole vocabulary. |
| `families.py --gaps` | filling the holes in numbered families — a family with three confirmed members is evidence about a fourth that no global rule can match. |
| `cross_type.py --from A --to B` | taking cores that exist in one asset type and spelling them the way another type spells things. Check `--measure` first: some pairs have no seam at all. |
| `sound_languages.py` | respelling a known sound in each of the twelve shipped languages and three encoding tags. Black Ops 4 only — Cold War's language tables are already complete. |
| `image_channels.py` | offering every other channel (`_c`, `_n`, `_g`, `_o`, `_m`, `_s`, `_r` …) of an image we hold one channel of. 88.8% of cores carry more than one. |
| `token_edits.py` | names one token longer or shorter than a known name. The only generator here that changes a name's length; everything else substitutes. |
| `materials_from_images.py` | stripping an image name to its core and offering it as a material, under all twelve directories and in both the `mtl_` and bare spellings. The material/image seam run backwards -- `images_from_materials` is the forward direction. **Measured near-spent**: 7 names in Cold War and 10 in Black Ops 4. |
| `affix_sweep.py` | **every** short prefix and suffix exhaustively, around stems you choose. The only generator that does not need a token to have been measured first — so it reaches affixes used once in the game, which no frequency-ranked list can hold. Sizes itself against a time budget and refuses to exceed it. Targeted, not scheduled: see METHODS.md. |

## Measuring

| script | |
|---|---|
| `derive_lists.py` | regenerates `data/prefixes.txt` and `data/suffixes.txt` from the tables **and** the confirmed names, and reports what its ceilings cut. Run it to repair vocabulary, **not** to reopen a spent method: three consecutive folds returned 55, 294 and 51 names, the last on a corpus two and a half times larger. The lists are capped, so every fold displaces as much as it adds. |
| `harvest_retail.py` | scrapes strings out of an unpacked game build. Only useful to somebody who owns one. |
| `harvest_bo4.py` | **reads the installed Black Ops 4 build.** Oodle block chains inside CASC BLTE frames, 141 GB of archives plus the loose `LPC/*.ff`. 273,138 strings, and **1 new name per 305** on the loose files -- second only to `final_byte.py`. `--game BLKOPSCW` points it at Cold War, whose fast files are AES-256-CTR and give nothing. Nothing decompressed is written down. |
| `harvest_bo3_assetlist.py` | **Black Ops 3's official asset names, from the manifests the tools ship** -- `zone_source/all/assetlist/*.csv`, 19 of them, one `type,name` row per asset. 106,836 names, found through the `TA_TOOLS_PATH` environment variable. Reads *only* that path and `zone/`: the rest of a mod tools tree is a working directory full of community assets, which look like official names, can never be in either game, and differ on every disk. |
| `harvest_iwd.py` | `.iwd` is a ZIP with the extension changed, so `zipfile` lists every path inside without decompressing anything. **Skips `mods/`, `usermaps/`, `workshop/`, `raw/` and `downloaded/`** -- a player-writable folder holds community assets, which look like official names, can never be in either game, and differ on every disk. 200 shipped archives, 528,229 names, **measured 0 on both games**. |
| `harvest_decorated.py` | writes the plan that wears harvested strings as **cores** under the beginnings and endings our own corpus measures. The half that breaks the corpus bound is the stem. |
| `borrowed_decorations.py` | the mirror: beginnings and endings measured on a build we are **not** searching, worn by cores cut from names we already hold. The half that breaks the bound is the wrapper. |
| `settings.py` | reads `config.toml`. A library, not a command. |

---

## Not for grinding

| script | |
|---|---|
| `tend.sh` | **The maintainer's, not a method.** Merges submission pull requests as they land and deletes the branches behind them, refusing anything that touches code and holding any new or changed generator for a human to read. Nothing an agent should run. |

### Not accepted

One contributed script has been refused and removed. The submission it arrived with was merged --
the names were confirmed and are kept -- but the script itself is not in the repository and should
not be re-added.

| script | |
|---|---|
| `overnight_suite_20260826-004415.py` | **Not allowed.** A fixed grinding rotation. This project is driven by an assistant deciding what to run next; a script that removes that decision is not accepted here, regardless of what it contains or how well it is written. See section 2 of `AGENTS.md`. |

This is a standing rule, not a judgement about one contributor. Anything of the same shape will be
refused the same way, and the names that come with it will still be kept.

## Contributing a script

The easiest way is to name it when you confirm:

```
python my_generator.py | confirm_list - --label "what it is" --script my_generator.py
```

`--script` copies it into the run, and `submit` puts it in the pull request under
`scripts/contributed/`. Two other routes work as well, so getting this wrong is hard: anything in
`contrib/` is carried, and so is any **new** file in `scripts/` itself. This is not politeness.
The names you found go into a table and are finished; the thing that found them makes every later
contributor faster, and that compounding is the only reason this project can outrun the size of
the problem.

### Your script gets moved, so do not count parent directories

This is the one thing that has broken every contributed script at once. You write a generator in
`contrib/` or in `scripts/`, and `submit` files it under `scripts/contributed/`. A path built from
a fixed number of parents is then correct where you wrote it and wrong where it lands:
`os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(__file__)) + "/scripts"` resolves to the repository root from
`contrib/`, and from `scripts/contributed/` it resolves to a *scripts/scripts* that has never
existed. Relying on `import snapshot` working because `snapshot.py` happens to sit next to you has
the same fault — it does, until the file moves.

All four scripts in `scripts/contributed/` shipped broken this way and none of them could be run
by anybody who pulled them. Find the root instead, and do it **before** importing `snapshot`
rather than under `if __name__ == "__main__"`, which runs far too late:

```python
import os
import sys

_root = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
while _root != os.path.dirname(_root) and not os.path.isfile(
    os.path.join(_root, "scripts", "snapshot.py")
):
    _root = os.path.dirname(_root)
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.join(_root, "scripts"))

import snapshot
```


**This is not hypothetical.** Seven scripts are named in the notes of submissions already merged
here -- `attachments.py`, `crosspool.py`, `modelvariants.py`, `numbervariants.py`, `pathmine.py`,
`soundtails.py`, `streamkeys.py` -- and **not one of them exists**. Between them they found tens of
thousands of names, and every later contributor has had to start without them. Find that list for
yourself with `grep -rho "scripts/[a-z_]*\.py" submissions/ | sort -u`.

A contributed script must have, at the top, in its docstring:

- **what problem it solves**, in one sentence
- **how to run it**, as a line that can be copied
- **what it reads** and **what it writes**
- **whether it is reusable or one-off** — a one-off is still worth contributing, labelled as one
- **what it measured**, if it measured anything: candidates produced, matches, how long

Do not contribute a script with no docstring. A generator nobody can tell the purpose of is worse
than no generator, because somebody will spend an hour working out what it was for.

## Writing a generator

Three rules, and the first is the only one that is really a rule.

1. **Build from names already known to be real.** The published tables, everybody's merged
   submissions, what this machine has confirmed. Never thin air. The median confirmed name has
   seven or eight underscore-separated segments; the space of word sequences that long passes
   2^63 long before the name does, so composing names out of a dictionary cannot work and
   recombining fragments of real names is the only shape that does.

2. **Print to standard output, one name per line, and stream.** `confirm_list` holds one batch at
   a time, so a generator that streams costs no disk at all. A `hash,name` line is accepted too,
   so a results file can be piped straight back in.

3. **Do not expand endings yourself.** The Rust engine peels endings off the wanted ids rather
   than appending them to candidates, which makes an ending nearly free; writing them out as text
   multiplies your output by 4,800 and asks the same question for a terabyte of disk. Generate
   interesting stems; let the general search dress them.

Check the arithmetic before running: a run of *n* candidates against *w* unnamed ids expects
`n * w / 2^63` matches by coincidence. `confirm_list` prints it. Anything seeded is effectively
zero; only unconstrained character sweeps get near one.
