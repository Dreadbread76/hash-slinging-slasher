## What this asks that nothing else does

Every beginning-list method here crosses a beginning with a **core** -- a name with something
trimmed off it. `uncarried.py` cuts at a segment boundary, `redecorations.py` ranks a beginning by
how much of its vocabulary is borrowed, `mcdp/` won by being crossed with the whole material
vocabulary rather than its own.

This asks the narrower question those all step over: **which strings turn one entire known name
into another entire known name.** `[korea15]` + `i_c_t8_zmb_ofc_hero_dempsey_jacket1_c` is a real
image, and so is the name without it. Nothing is trimmed; the base name is carried whole.

That makes the borrowed share `redecorations.py` ranks by **100% by construction** -- every
instance counted is, by definition, a name we already hold wearing this decoration. The dead end
recorded in METHODS.md for uncarried beginnings ("0 on Black Ops 4 and 7 on Cold War in 945 M
candidates") is the opposite case: beginnings crossed with a vocabulary that was never theirs. The
note closing it says to rank by borrowed share first, and this is that ranking taken to its limit.

## Measured on 2026-08-23, over 1,521,504 known names

4,893 distinct strings wrap one known name into another. 309 of them are absent from
`data/prefixes.txt` at three instances or more, so no general pass can build them:

    mcdp/mtl_          385     the one already mined -- 2,846 names on 2026-08-23
    [korea15]          151     a regional build variant. 151 of 151 base names are known
    paintjob_          132
    mc/mtl_menu_        77
    mc/mtl_wpn_t9_      70
    [japanese]          39     39 of 39 base names known
    img_trim_           31
    ui_icon_mtx_tier_   30

`[korea15]`, `[japanese]` and `[safe]` are worth calling out because they are invisible to every
character-level method in the project as well: `[` occurs in no name's last four characters, so the
alphabet `tails.py` measures cannot spell them from either end.

The cost is one beginning list against the corpus -- 309 x 1.5 M, about 470 M candidates, seconds
of engine time. `--min` moves the threshold; `--suffix` measures the mirror, decorations that wrap
a name at the *end*, which is a much longer list (8,059 boundary-anchored at fifteen instances) and
overlaps the uncarried-endings methods already run.
